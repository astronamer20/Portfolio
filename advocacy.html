MOUNTAIN LAKES(NJ)- The Medical Needs Foundation will be hosting its annual BBQ Bash on June 4th at Briarcliff Middle School from 7pm to 11pm to fundraise for families struggling to pay medical bills. 

<br>
<br>
The BBQ Bash is an amazing opportunity to enjoy the late spring weather, meet new people in the community and enjoy delicious barbecue while supporting a good cause. The Medical Needs Foundation works directly with grant applicants and families to confirm the need, and to help evaluate the other means of support. The foundation has helped over 200 people and raised more than 2.5 million dollars since its inception.  “Everyone on the board is here because we truly believe in what we do here,” says Medical Needs Foundation board president Andrew Purcell, “Nothing represents our spirit more than the idea of ‘neighbors helping neighbors’.”
<br>
<br>

The Medical Needs Foundation is a 501(c)3 recognized charity dedicated to helping Morris County residents pay for medical expenses which are not covered by insurance. “Our goal is to help people who are above the income limit to be eligible for medicaid, but are struggling to pay for the medical care they need,” says Purcell.

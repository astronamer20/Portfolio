<h1>A New Jersey grocery store raises prices amid high inflation.</h1>
<br>
<h2>As inflation increases across the economy, the prices of everything- even food- have risen.</h2>
<br>
By Daniel Teytel
<br><br>
NEW BRUNSWICK(NJ)- A New Jersey grocery store owner says food prices have increased storewide led by rising prices throughout the supply chain. 
<br>
<br>
Jyn Whitehurst is the owner of a small grocery store. Over the past year, he says he has been forced to raise prices.
<br>
<br>
“Everything’s becoming more expensive,” Whitehurst said, “If we didn’t start raising the prices, we wouldn't be in business anymore.” 
<br>
<br>
Many of the goods Whitehurst seeks to buy are in short supply, preventing Whitehurst from fully resupplying his store. “There are many things I just can’t find, and many others are in low supply,” Whitehurst said. “I haven’t been able to get any baking soda delivered in months.”
<br>
<br>
Whitehurst says inflation outside the food industry has also been impacting the store. He says the price of gas, for instance, has been increasing the commuting cost for some employees. As a result of this, Whitehurst says he has spent more money on salaries this year than he had in previous years. Whitehurst says he doesn’t face these issues alone. He says that the issues he faces all originate at other levels in the supply chain, which other stores also interact with. As a result, he says it is likely that most- if not all- of the grocery stores in New Jersey are dealing with the same issues. 
<br>
<br>
“I just wish people knew this wasn’t our fault.” Whitehurst said, “We aren’t trying to be greedy; we’re only doing what we need to do to avoid going out of business. I hope people can understand we aren’t doing this to spite them, if we could avoid raising our prices, we would.”
<br>
<br>
Whitehurst said that his price increases are a direct result of the price increases of businesses further up the supply chain. Rebecca Zamsky is the manager of a food processing facility which supplies stores around New Jersey.
<br>
<br>
“It’s becoming more difficult to find and retain enough workers to continue operating at our normal rate,” Zamsky said. Zamsky said many employees who had worked at the facility before the pandemic have resigned after the facility reopened.
<br>
<br>
Zamsky also said that the company had spent more money on wages this year, citing inflation in other sectors of the economy as a cause for this increase. 
<br>
<br>
“We aren’t able to operate at our pre-covid levels… We can’t afford to. If we produce any more than we are now, we’d begin losing profits,” Zamsky said, “if we hadn’t raised our prices, we would be producing even less."
<br>
<br>
Zamsky discussed the stress that these changes have created for her, as well as her anxieties about the future. “It’s really tough staying in business right now,” Zamsky said, “It feels like there’s a new problem each week. I’m worried that we might be forced to shut down soon if something doesn’t change fast.”
<br>
<br>
The Consumer Price Index has announced that the inflation rate reached 7.5% in January, the highest rate since 1982.
